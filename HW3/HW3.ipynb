    "Number of cells is $N$ so number of points is $N+1$. Our initial condition is $t=2$ from the exact solution. We time step from $t=2$ to $t=4$ on a grid with $N=100$ points with RK4 time stepping, crank nicolson. For RK4 we report the stable time step, and for crank-nicolson, we show the scheme is stable for large CFL. Note that we will need to use a tridiagonal solver to solve the system of equations. The Thomas Algorithm (a tridiagonal solver) is available online, and copy pasted below."
